    "The first step entails that we model EV charging profiles for each charging station for different grid tariff structures. We consider two scenarios for each tariff structure: a scenario with fixed retail electricity prices and a scenario with dynamic retail electricity prices.

In a later step, the tariff value that corresponds with cost-recovery is determined for each EV adoption rate."

We consider the same number of tariffs and the hours for low, medium and high tariff hours as with volumetric ToU tariffs. The main difference is that a specific capacity is available for each tariff value at low, medium and high tariff hours. At low tariff hours, the low grid tariff applies for the first 4 kW of charging, and charging above this up to 8 kW is charged the medium grid tariff, and all extra charging the high grid tariff. At medium tariff hours, the medium grid tariff applies for the first 4 kW of charging, after which the high tariff applies for all charging above this value. At high tariff hours, the high grid tariff applies for all charging. "
