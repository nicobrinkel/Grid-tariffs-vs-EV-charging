This repository contains the codes and results of the manuscript titled: **"Can grid tariffs be fair and efficient? A comprehensive evaluation of tariff designs for smart electric vehicle integration"**.

The following repository is maintained by [Nico Brinkel](https://github.com/nicobrinkel) and Floris van Montfoort.

Highlights:

- Grid tariff reforms are needed incentivize efficient grid use and ensure a fair allocation of costs in the face of rising electrification and grid congestion.<br>
- This work aims to comprehensively evaluate grid tariff designs based on regulatory principles, specifically focusing on the impact on EV charging patterns.<br>
- Six grid tariff structures are evaluated based on four performance indicators, linked to regulatory principles.<br>
- No single tariff structure excels across all regulatory principles. Capacity-based tariff structures lead to highest system efficiency.
